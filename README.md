## Technical Commentary
<details open>
<ul>
    <li>I have been using npm for all projects up to now. This time I try yarn.</li>
    <li>i18n internationalization for Next.js installed. It is very intuitive, just prepare a few json of text.</li>
    <li>react-intersection-observer installed. It can be used for viewport-based animation.</li>
    <li>The website is experiencing flashing and layout collapse due to component render. I should probably provide a static HTML frame, wrap components in div container if need to be. Right now it feels like trying to build a tower using jelly!</li>
</ul>
